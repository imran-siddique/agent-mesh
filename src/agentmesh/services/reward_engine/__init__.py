"""
Reward Engine Service

Async worker that processes Flight Recorder logs and updates trust scores.

This service wraps the core reward engine to provide:
- Continuous trust score updates
- Multi-dimensional scoring
- Auto-revocation triggers
- Behavioral pattern detection

Status: Not yet implemented. Use agentmesh.reward.engine directly.
See: src/agentmesh/reward/engine.py for the core RewardEngine.
