Audit Service

Merkle-chained logger for tamper-evident audit trails.

This service wraps the core audit logging to provide:
- Immutable event history
- Cryptographic verification
- Compliance audit trails
- Query and export capabilities

Status: Not yet implemented. Use agentmesh.governance.audit directly.
See: src/agentmesh/governance/audit.py for the core AuditLog and MerkleAuditChain.
