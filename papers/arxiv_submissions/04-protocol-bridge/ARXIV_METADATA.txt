Unified Trust Bridge for Heterogeneous Agent Protocols: Consistent Governance Across A2A, MCP, and IATP

ABSTRACT (plain text, no LaTeX, no line breaks):
The AI agent ecosystem is fragmenting across incompatible protocols. Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) handles inter-agent coordination. Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) governs tool access. The Inter-Agent Trust Protocol (IATP) defines trust handshakes. Each protocol solves a slice of the problem—none provides trust across protocol boundaries. We present TrustBridge, a unified governance layer that speaks A2A, MCP, and IATP natively while enforcing a consistent trust model. When Agent A (on A2A) delegates to Agent B (on MCP), TrustBridge translates the request, performs capability verification, and ensures the audit trail spans both protocols seamlessly. Key innovations include: (1) Protocol-agnostic trust handshakes completing in <200ms cross-protocol, (2) Capability scope translation preserving security invariants across protocol boundaries, and (3) Unified audit trails enabling compliance reporting regardless of underlying protocol. Experiments on multi-protocol agent workflows demonstrate: 98.7% handshake success rate, 147ms median cross-protocol latency (vs. 892ms for naive gateway), and zero capability escalation across 10,000 cross-protocol delegations.
