## Overview

ISO 42001 provides a management system standard for organizations developing, providing, or using AI systems. AgentMesh's governance, trust, and audit capabilities support many of the technical controls required by the standard.

---

## Clause 4 — Context of the Organization

| ISO 42001 Requirement | AgentMesh Feature | Status |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 4.1 Understanding the organization | Agent registry documents all agents, capabilities, and trust relationships | ✅ Supported |
| 4.2 Interested parties | `UserContext` tracks human stakeholders; delegation chains identify authorization sources | ✅ Supported |
| 4.3 Scope of the AIMS | Policy engine scope covers all agents within the mesh boundary | ✅ Supported |

---

## Clause 5 — Leadership

| ISO 42001 Requirement | AgentMesh Feature | Status |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 5.1 Leadership commitment | Human sponsor root in delegation chains ensures human accountability | ✅ Supported |
| 5.2 AI policy | Declarative YAML/JSON + Rego policy rules with version control | ✅ Supported |
| 5.3 Roles and responsibilities | Delegation chains define responsibility hierarchy; capability scoping defines permissions | ✅ Supported |

---

## Clause 6 — Planning

| ISO 42001 Requirement | AgentMesh Feature | Status |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 6.1 Actions to address risks | Trust scoring (5 dimensions), anomaly detection (5 classes), policy verdicts | ✅ Supported |
| 6.1.4 AI risk assessment | Trust score tiers map to risk levels; anomaly severity classification | ✅ Supported |
| 6.2 AI objectives | Trust score thresholds define measurable objectives per agent | ✅ Supported |

---

## Clause 7 — Support

| ISO 42001 Requirement | AgentMesh Feature | Status |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 7.1 Resources | Resource efficiency dimension in trust scoring (15% weight) tracks utilization | ✅ Supported |
| 7.2 Competence | Competence dimension in trust scoring tracks task success rate | ✅ Supported |
| 7.4 Communication | AI Card discovery enables transparent agent communication | ✅ Supported |
| 7.5 Documented information | Merkle audit chains, AI Card metadata, ARCHITECTURE.md | ✅ Supported |

---

## Clause 8 — Operation

| ISO 42001 Requirement | AgentMesh Feature | Status |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 8.1 Operational planning | Policy engine enforces governance rules; shadow mode tests before deployment | ✅ Supported |
| 8.2 AI risk assessment (operational) | Runtime anomaly detection, trust decay monitoring, Prometheus metrics | ✅ Supported |
| 8.3 AI risk treatment | Credential revocation (≤ 5 s), trust override, tool blocking, capability restriction | ✅ Supported |
| 8.4 AI system impact assessment | Compliance module maps actions to regulatory frameworks | ✅ Supported |

---

## Clause 9 — Performance Evaluation

| ISO 42001 Requirement | AgentMesh Feature | Status |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 9.1 Monitoring and measurement | Trust scores, anomaly counts, policy violation metrics via Prometheus | ✅ Supported |
| 9.2 Internal audit | Merkle audit logs with `verify_integrity()` tamper detection | ✅ Supported |
| 9.3 Management review | CloudEvents export to SIEM (Splunk, Azure Event Grid, AWS EventBridge) for review dashboards | ✅ Supported |

---

## Clause 10 — Improvement

| ISO 42001 Requirement | AgentMesh Feature | Status |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 10.1 Continual improvement | Trust decay and reputation engine provide continuous feedback loops | ✅ Supported |
| 10.2 Nonconformity and corrective action | Anomaly detection triggers alerts; trust score drops trigger automatic capability restriction | ✅ Supported |

---

## Annex A Controls

Key Annex A controls and AgentMesh mappings:

| Control | Description | AgentMesh Feature | Status |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| A.2 AI Policy | Documented AI policy | YAML/JSON + Rego governance rules | ✅ Supported |

## Gaps and Roadmap

| ISO 42001 Area | Gap | Planned Mitigation |
|---------------|-----|-------------------|
| A.7 Data management | Per-user data access policies not yet implemented | Planned: per-user policy rules via `UserContext` |
| 6.3 Planning of changes | No formal change management workflow for policy updates | Planned: policy versioning and rollback module |
| 8.4 Impact assessment | Automated impact assessment tooling not yet built | Planned: impact assessment templates in compliance module |
